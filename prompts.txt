Monte Carlo simulations were employed to ensure statistical homogeneity across identified regions. The Regional GEV Distribution was selected as the underlying model for extreme rainfall data. To achieve accurate peak flow estimation, regional frequency analysis was utilized to generate non-stationary quantile estimates.
